### Hi, I am Alex Tsvetanov ðŸ‘‹              

I am 21 years old and I am devloping tools, libraries, and software for over a decade now. I am looking to learn new things every day and not to waste a single minute of my life. I have no problems dealing with the university, work, and side projects all at once. This hunger for new experiences, projects, and knowledge are ever-lastng and will be like that for a quite some time moving forward.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the best performing so far C++ Web Framework - WebFrame++. I am planning to make it the only library to develop cross-platform Web and Mobile applications. How? You will see.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter
